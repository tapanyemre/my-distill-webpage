## Short Bio

I am a PhD Student in Political Science at Northeastern University. I earned my B.A. in Economics from Bogazici University and my M.Sc. in Middle East Studies from METU. My research sits at the intersection of data science and social sciences. I specialize in social network analysis and computational text analysis to study online polarization, online extremism and non-state actors with a particular focus on how they radicalize.

I am a graduate of SICSS-Helsinki in 2018 and ICPSR Summer Program in 2020 as one of the recipients of the Scholarship for Political Science Research. I am co-organizer of Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Istanbul. I am also the lead of Istanbul Twitter Develeoper Community.
