I am a PhD Student in Political Science at Northeastern University. I earned my B.A. in Economics from Bogazici University and my M.Sc. in Middle East Studies from METU. My research sits at the intersection of data science and social sciences. I specialize in social network analysis and computational text analysis to study online polarization, online extremism and non-state actors with a particular focus on how they radicalize.

I am a graduate of SICSS-Helsinki in 2018 and ICPSR Summer Program in 2020 as one of the recipients of the Scholarship for Political Science Research. I am co-organizer of Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Istanbul. I am also the lead of Istanbul Twitter Develeoper Community.

organization: Oxford Spring School in Advanced Research Methods organization_url: ‘https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/spring-school/oxford-spring-school-in-advanced-research-methods.html' title: Machine Learning url: ‘https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/spring-school/course-outline.html?schoolid=517' certificate_url: '’ date_start: ‘2021-04-19’ date_end: ‘2021-04-23’ description: ‘Computational techniques broadly referred to as “machine learning” (ML) are attracting increasing attention in the social sciences. This course will introduce students to the fundamental theories and concepts used across ML techniques (e.g maximum likelihood estimation, classification, overfitting, and cross-validation), and how to apply various popular ML techniques (e.g. LASSO, random forests, bayesian additive regression trees, and neural networks). This course will also pay particular attention to inferential problems regarding how best to use ML methods in social science contexts and discuss practical issues (e.g. computational power and parallelisation). Students on this course are required to be familiar with probability and statistics (OLS, hypothesis testing, logistic regression) and to have basic knowledge of the R programming language.’

The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived). Topics covered include text as data, website scraping, digital field experiments, non-probability sampling, mass collaboration, and ethics.’
